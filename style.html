      <h2>Style</h2>
      <p>My Bloody Valentine's musical style progressed throughout their career. The band were originally influenced by post-punk, in particular <cite class="artist">The Birthday Party</cite>, <cite class="artist">The Cramps</cite> and <cite class="artist">Joy Division</cite>, and as author Mike McGonial noted, <q>"brought together the least interesting elements"</q> of their influences. Their debut mini album, <cite class="album">This is Your Bloody Valentine</cite> (1985), incorporated a further gothic rock sound which AllMusic referred to as <q>"unfocused and derivative"</q>. However, when the band began experimenting with indie pop melodies on <cite class="album">The New Record by My Bloody Valentine</cite> (1986), it marked a vital point in the development of their sound, which was influenced primarily by <cite class="artist">The Jesus and Mary Chain</cite>. The band later took a <q>"rarified, effete and poppy approach to Byrdsian rock"</q> with their two successive releases, <cite class="single">"Strawberry Wine"</cite> and <cite class="ep">Ecstasy</cite> (1987). <cite class="album">Isn't Anything</cite>, and its preceding release <cite class="ep">You Made Me Realise</cite> (1988), were influenced by American indie rock bands, most notably <cite class="artist">Dinosaur Jr.</cite> and <cite class="artist">Sonic Youth</cite>, as well as hip hop music. <cite class="album">Loveless</cite> (1991) was influenced by a wide range of genres, including dream pop, noise rock and house music. In the mid-1990s, during the recording of <cite class="album">m b v</cite> (2013), Kevin Shields and Colm Ó Cíosóig began experimenting with drum and bass music, which was an underground trend in London at the time. Elements of jungle music were incorporated into m<cite class="album"> b v</cite>, particularly the final three tracks—<cite class="single">"In Another Way"</cite>, <cite class="single">"Nothing Is"</cite> and <cite class="single">"Wonder 2"</cite>—which marked a further shift in My Bloody Valentine's sound that Pitchfork Media referred to as "so surprising and ultimately powerful."</p>

      <p>One of the most recognisable aspects of My Bloody Valentine's music is Shields' guitar sound, which <q>"use[s] texture more than technique to create vivid soundscapes."</q> During the late 1980s, Shields began customising the tremolo systems for his Fender Jaguars and Jazzmasters; extending the tremolo arm and loosening it considerably, to allow him to manipulate the arm while strumming chords, which resulted in excessive pitch bending. Shields used a number of alternate and open tunings that together with his tremolo manipulation achieved <q>"a strange warping effect that makes the music wander in and out of focus"</q>, according to Rolling Stone. Shields' most notable effect is reverse digital reverb, sourced from a Yamaha SPX90 effects unit. Together with the tremolo manipulation and distortion, he created a technique known as "glide guitar". Shields effects rig, which is composed largely of distortion, graphic equalizers and tone controls, consists of at least 30 effects pedals and is connected to a large amount of amplifiers, which are often set to maximum volume to increase sustain. During live performances, and in particular the closing song <cite class="single">"You Made Me Realise"</cite>, My Bloody Valentine perform an interlude of noise and excessive feedback, known as "the holocaust", which would last for half an hour and often reached 130<abbr title="decibels">db</abbr>. Shields later remarked <q>"it was so loud it was like sensory deprivation. We just liked the fact that we could see a change in the audience at a certain point."</q></p>
