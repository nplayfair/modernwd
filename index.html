    <p>My Bloody Valentine are an Irish rock band formed in Dublin in 1983. Since 1987, the band's lineup has consisted of founding members Kevin Shields (vocals, guitar) and Colm Ó Cíosóig (drums), with Bilinda Butcher (vocals, guitar) and Debbie Googe (bass). The group are known for their integration of noise, melody, and unorthodox guitar and production techniques. Their work in the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in their pioneering a musical style known as <i>shoegazing</i>. </p>

    <p>Following several membership changes and unsuccessful releases, My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records in 1988. The band released a number of successful EPs, including <cite class="album">You Made Me Realise (1988)</cite>, <cite class="album">Glider (1990)</cite> and <cite class="album">Tremolo (1991)</cite>, and two studio albums, <cite class="album">Isn't Anything (1988)</cite> and <cite class="album">Loveless (1991)</cite> on the label. <cite class="album">Loveless</cite>, which has been described as the band's magnum opus and one of the best albums of the 1990s, was a major critical success. However, the band were dropped by Creation Records after its release due to the album's extensive production costs. In 1992, My Bloody Valentine signed to Island Records and recorded several albums worth of unreleased material, remaining largely inactive. Following the departure of Googe and Ó Cíosóig in 1995, My Bloody Valentine later disbanded in 1997.</p>

    <p>In 2007, Shields announced My Bloody Valentine had reformed and the band subsequently toured across Europe, Asia and North America. Following reissues of both <cite class="album">Isn't Anything</cite> and <cite class="album">Loveless</cite>, and the release of the compilation album <cite class="album">EP's 1988–1991 (2012)</cite>, My Bloody Valentine's long-delayed third studio album, <cite class="album">m b v</cite>, was released on 2 February 2013, 22 years after the release of their last full-length album.</p>
